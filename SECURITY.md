# Phoenix Bug Bounty Program

## Bug Bounty Overview

This bug bounty program is specifically for [Phoenix](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/phoenix-v1)’s smart contract code and [Sokoban](https://github.com/Ellipsis-Labs/sokoban/blob/master/src/red_black_tree.rs)’s red-black tree implementation. All relevant code is open source.

Our bug bounty security guidelines are based on [Immunefi’s vulnerability severity classification system](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/), and are subject to change at any time.

The bug bounty program is administered by Ellipsis Labs and OtterSec. All bug bounty decisions made are final.

Bugs in `phoenix-sdk` and other code outside of the smart contract will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

## Report Submission

Please email maintainers@ellipsislabs.xyz with a detailed description of the attack vector. For high- and critical-severity reports, please include a proof of concept on a deployed fork of the relevant programs. We will reach back out within 24 hours with additional questions or next steps on the bug bounty.

## Scope

The following components are explicitly out of scope for the bounty program.

- Vulnerabilities that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage
- Any UI bugs
- Bugs in the core Solana runtime (please submit these to [Solana’s bug bounty program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/security/policy))
- Bugs in the Sokoban library that do not affect the red-black tree
- Vulnerabilities that require a validator to execute them
- Vulnerabilities requiring access to privileged keys/credentials
- MEV vectors the team is already aware of
